## Description
A responsive web application for a pizza shop called Pizzapalo, where users can customize their pizza toppings. This project utilizes the Vite framework, React library, and Tailwind CSS for styling. It showcases the use of objects, for loops, and other methods to accomplish the pizza customization functionality. The application is designed to be adaptable and can be used by any pizza shop to enhance their online ordering experience. 

For testing details, please refer to the [TEST.md](https://github.com/RemyXVX/Pizza-Parlor/blob/main/TEST.md) file.

## Setup/Installation Requirements
### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To run the Pizza Parlor project locally, follow these steps:
* Use Chrome web browser for best compatibility.
* Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
```
git clone http://github.com/RemyXVX/Pizza-Parlor.git
```
* Set up a development environment with a prompt and editor to make changes.
<br /> I choose to use [<strong>gitbash</strong>](https://git-scm.com/downloads)  and [<strong>vscode</strong>](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) because I'm broke and compatibltiy
* <strike>Install [<strong>Node</strong>](https://nodejs.org/en) for the required dependencies.</strike> NO MORE OF THAT BS [<strong>VITE</strong>](https://vitejs.dev/) IS LIFE!!
<br />(jk, [<strong>node</strong>](https://nodejs.org/en) will be useful later on when we start adding on to the ordering system.)
* Once in your favorite EDI or text editor, we will have to run a couple of commands
<br />to get the project running:
```
npm install 
(to install dependences, which is quick af with vite)

npm run build
(never hurts to double check for errors)

npm run dev
(to get that puppy up and running!)
```
* If some odd reason Vite doesn't link youa localhost, it natively goes to:
<br />[http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/)
* From there, go ahead and explore the pages!

## Known Bugs
* <strike>Currently still working on applying my business logic into the code. I have been able to successfully push most of the user interface onto the DOM.</strike>
* After adding some more pages, and trying to get the styling more or less the same, I have hit a wall. Currently we are working on adding an ordering system. I might be making one from the ground up.. but I'm going to see what I can apply to the project, something like shopify or grubhub (I need to look at this API and cost...remember, I'm broke.) Also, I currently have the email set up to send the emails to an excel shit and I get a notifcation via email that something was sent (I'm getting an error because of some null values but hey! it notifies me off an email so I consider it a win.) I might move this to a whole back-end API in the future, or find another hack.
